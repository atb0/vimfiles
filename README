### vimrc, plugins, and colors


The file .vimrc and the folder .vim should be placed in your home directory

My .vimrc file is mostly commented, and would probably make a decent starting
point for .vimrc files

If my comments are not descriptive enough, type the command 
':help commandname' "e.g., ':help textwidth'
to see the actual option documentation

Todo:add colorschemes and re-oraganize
